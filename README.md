# Local-PDP

Feature Attribution Model-Agnostic **Python library** for Machine Learning **Explainability**.

This repository implements `lpdp` python library with several feature attribution agnostic-model methods for explaining predictions of machine learning models.
Mainly, it focuses on **Local-PDP** (Local Partial Dependence Plots) method, which is designed to provide reliable explanations in any dataset, removing PDP independence assumptions.
