class Kernel(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for kernel functions.

    A kernel function is a mathematical function with the following properties:
    1. It is non-negative: K(x) >= 0 for all x.
    2. It integrates to one over the entire real line.
    3. It is symmetric: K(x) = K(-x) for all x.

    The kernels implemented here are multi variants with size N.
    The arguments are 2 vectors of size N, and the bandwidth is a matrix of size NxN.

    Mathematical note:
        These kernels are all stationary, meaning they depend only on the distance between points,
        not on their absolute positions.
        This is a requirement for KDE.

    Implementation note:
        These kernels uses Bandwidth class for efficient matrix computation.
