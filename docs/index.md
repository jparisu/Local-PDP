# yourlib Documentation

Welcome to the yourlib documentation! This library provides tools for Feature Attribution Study and Machine Learning Explainability using Local-PDP (Local Partial Dependence Plot) analysis.

## Overview

yourlib is a Python library designed to help data scientists and machine learning practitioners understand and explain their models through advanced feature attribution techniques.

## Features

- **Submodule A**: Core functionality for feature attribution analysis
- **Submodule B**: Additional supporting tools for explainability
- **Utilities**: Helper functions for common operations

## Quick Start

```python
from yourlib.submodule_a.a import function_a, ClassA
from yourlib.submodule_b.b import function_b, ClassB
from yourlib import utils

# Use function_a
result = function_a(5)
print(result)  # Output: 10

# Use ClassA
obj = ClassA(42)
print(obj.method_a())  # Output: 42
```

## Installation

```bash
pip install yourlib
```
